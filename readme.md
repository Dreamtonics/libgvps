libgvps stands for Generic Viterbi Path Searcher.

This library is an implementation of Viterbi algorithm that helps you find the most likely sequence given a set of states or candidates over a certain time period and the state transition probabilities.

libgvps allows the states/candidates space to be dense or sparse or even circular; transition probabilities can be either static or dynamic as opposed to time.
